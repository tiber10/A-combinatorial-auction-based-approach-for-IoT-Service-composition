# A-combinatorial-auction-based-approach-for-IoT-Service-composition
The present project transforms the service composition problem into an optimization problem. Moreover, in this project we also propose a combinatorial auction approach (the Or bids method) in order to provide the best services selection to construct the service composition.

## Results and Discussion
This project was a shared project between Hana NECIB for master's graduation and Me.
The input are the quality of services and randomly we generate the indicators. The Qos values are defined in a specific range . After that the data should be normalized for efficiency results. Service composition (output) is coded in a 1-dimensional array of two columns, represented in the Maximum of reputation and The minimum of other factors ( response time , distance , energy of the services and indicators ) and a set of indicators. The table below shows the quality of services and their range.
